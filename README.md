### Importance of identifying the design properties of a mock up design
Identifying design properties of a mock-up design is important because it helps ensure clarity and consistency in the final product. It allows designers and stakeholders to understand key elements like layout, color schemes, typography, and functionality early on, making it easier to spot issues, gather feedback, and make informed decisions before development. This saves time, reduces costly changes later, and improves the overall user experience.
